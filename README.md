# ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch

Welcome to ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. Currently, it includes implementations for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Lasso Regression.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

2. **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

4. **Lasso Regression**: Lasso regression is a regularization technique used to perform regression analysis while encouraging sparsity in the coefficients. It is particularly useful in settings where the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations.

5. **KNN Classifier**: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier classifies data points based on the majority label of their 'k' nearest neighbors. It is a simple, non-parametric algorithm effective for small datasets. 

## How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file. To use any of the implemented algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to use:
    ```bash
    cd ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch
    ```

3. Run the Python script for the desired algorithm:
    ```bash
    python linear_regression.py
    ```

   Replace `linear_regression.py` with the name of the Python script for the algorithm you want to use.
